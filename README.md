# Alfred Spongebob Mocking Text Workflow
An Alfred workflow to generate SpONgEbOb MocKing TeXt.

Requirements: `python3` must be installed on your machine.

To use: once installed, invoke Alfred, type `mock ` plus your string, and hit enter. The modified text will be automatically copied to your clipboard for use elsewhere.

A big thank you to [Kevin Waugh](https://github.com/kwaugh/Aflred-Spongebob-Mocking-Text) for the initial version of this all those years ago; I went this route both to learn Python, as well as to simplify the code w/ the changes `python3` brought to the ecosystem.
